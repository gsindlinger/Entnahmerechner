The pay-as-you-go pension system in Germany is facing considerable pressure from the demographic change. In addition to corporate pension plans, private pension plans will therefore gain enormous importance in the future. Money saved during the working phase should serve to maintain the desired standard of living in retirement.

Finally, the saved funds are usually withdrawn at periodic intervals and used for living expenses. Ideally, the amount not taken out of the savings is reinvested. An important factor is the investment choice, which involves varying degrees of risk depending on the expected return. Accordingly, a possible modeling of the interaction between the return development of the investment and the periodic withdrawal is complex. These concepts are only comprehensible with reasonable effort for a minority of the persons concerned and cause an information barrier between the service providers of such products and the potential customers.

Basically, assuming a given annuity period, those affected are usually interested in the following questions: What is the maximum amount of money that can be withdrawn within a period to bridge the desired pension duration? And will there possibly even be some of the savings left over if the savings are cleverly invested during retirement? The aim of this work was to answer these fundamental questions in a clear and visual way.
